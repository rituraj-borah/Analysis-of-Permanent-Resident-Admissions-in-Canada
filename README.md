# Analysis of Permanent Resident Admissions in Canada

## Overview
This project aims to analyze trends in permanent residency in Canada, leveraging data from various sources to understand the transition dynamics from temporary to permanent residency. This analysis is especially relevant in the wake of the news article published on June 16, 2023, highlighting Canada's population milestone of 40 million. The project seeks to provide a detailed visual exploration of how different pathways contribute to permanent residency, emphasizing provincial distributions, country of citizenship, and the role of education (study permits) in this transition.

## Data Sources
Our analysis utilizes datasets from the Open Government Portal of Canada, focusing on the transition from temporary resident status to permanent residency, express entry systems, and the demographics of study permit holders. The datasets include:

- **Transition from Temporary Resident to Permanent Resident Status - Monthly IRCC Updates**: This dataset provides province-wise data on individuals transitioning from temporary to permanent resident status, offering insights into regional trends and the effectiveness of various pathways to permanent residency.

- **Express Entry - Invited Candidates - Monthly IRCC Updates**: Focusing on express entry invitations and applications at the provincial level, this dataset helps in understanding the express entry system's role in facilitating permanent residency.

- **Temporary Residents: Study Permit Holders - Monthly IRCC Updates**: By analyzing study permit holders by country of citizenship and the year the permits became effective, this dataset sheds light on the educational background of potential permanent residents.

- **Permanent Residents - Monthly IRCC Updates**: Detailing permanent resident admissions by country of citizenship, this dataset allows for an exploration of the global diversity of Canada's permanent residents.

- **Express Entry Permanent Residents - Monthly IRCC Updates**: This dataset focuses on express entry admissions by country of citizenship, providing a closer look at this specific pathway to permanent residency.

## Objectives
- To understand the impact of various pathways on permanent residency trends in Canada.
- To analyze provincial variations in permanent residency admissions.
- To explore the role of education (via study permits) in the transition to permanent residency.
- To examine the diversity of permanent residents in terms of country of citizenship.

## Methodology
The project will employ a combination of data visualization tools and statistical analysis methods to interpret the datasets. Our approach includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Excel to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- Visualization techniques using Tableau to illustrate trends, distributions, and patterns.
- Comparative analysis to identify provincial differences and the impact of different pathways to permanent residency.

## Significance
This project is significant for policymakers, educational institutions, prospective immigrants, and researchers interested in understanding the dynamics of permanent residency in Canada. By providing a detailed analysis of the transition from temporary to permanent residency, this project contributes valuable insights into the factors influencing Canada's demographic trends and immigration policies.
